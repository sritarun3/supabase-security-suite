### Warnings to Fix üü°
1. **Pydantic Deprecation Warnings** (3 instances)
   - Need to migrate from `class Config` to `ConfigDict`
   - Low priority but should be fixed before PyPI release

2. **datetime.utcnow() Deprecation** (Multiple instances)
   - Python 3.13 recommends `datetime.now(datetime.UTC)`
   - Should update throughout codebase

## Performance Characteristics

### Scan Performance
- **Small Project** (< 100 files): ~1-2 seconds
- **Medium Project** (100-1000 files): ~3-10 seconds
- **Large Project** (1000+ files): ~30-60 seconds

### Resource Usage
- **Memory**: ~50-150 MB typical
- **CPU**: Multi-core aware (async I/O)
- **Network**: Minimal (only for API testing scanners)

---

## Known Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **Exclusion Patterns** - Not fully implemented yet
   - Workaround: Manually exclude directories before scanning
   
2. **Large File Handling** - 10MB default limit
   - Configurable via `max_file_size_mb`
   
3. **Git History Scanning** - Placeholder only
   - Requires gitleaks integration

### Future Enhancements
1. **Plugin System** - For custom scanners
2. **Distributed Scanning** - For very large codebases
3. **Real-time File Watching** - Continuous scanning
4. **Advanced AI Features** - Auto-remediation suggestions

---

## Deployment Options

### 1. Local Installation (Development)
```bash
pip install -e .
suite scan /path/to/project
```

### 2. Docker Deployment (Production)
```bash
docker build -t supabase-security-suite .
docker run -v /path/to/project:/scan supabase-security-suite
```

### 3. CI/CD Integration
```yaml
- name: Security Scan
  run: |
    pip install supabase-security-suite
    suite scan . --output report.json
    suite ci --fail-on critical,high
```

### 4. Dashboard Server (Enterprise)
```bash
suite-dashboard --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

## Security Considerations

### Secure by Default
- ‚úÖ No data sent to external services (unless AI enabled)
- ‚úÖ Secrets never logged in plaintext
- ‚úÖ Read-only file system access
- ‚úÖ Database credentials encrypted in memory
- ‚úÖ HTTPS support for dashboard

### Recommended Practices
1. **Run with least privilege** - Don't use root
2. **Isolate scans** - Use containers or VMs
3. **Secure API keys** - Use environment variables
4. **Review findings** - Don't auto-remediate without review
5. **Regular updates** - Keep scanners up-to-date
